## üìö Current Projects & Research

### ISP Billing System
A full-stack ISP billing solution, built using **NestJS** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The system features:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control, secure login mechanisms
- **Billing & Payments**: Integrated with third-party payment APIs for seamless transactions
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management, financial reporting, and monitoring capabilities
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data integrity and scalability

### Pest Identification & Survey App
A Flutter-based application that leverages AI for **real-time pest recognition** to support agricultural monitoring. Key highlights:
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses a custom-trained model with TensorFlow for pest classification
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Different interfaces for surveyors, farmers, and administrators
- **Data Visualization**: Map-based visualization of pest distribution using geolocation data
- **Backend & API**: Hosted with Streamlit and a RESTful API for model inference

### AI in Health
An Artificial Intelligence Solution designed to detect pandemics in their early stages

## üß© Technical Challenges & Problem Solving

### Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition
- Developed a Python-based emotion recognition tool that analyzes facial expressions in real-time. Used **OpenCV** for image capture, **TensorFlow** for model inference, and **matplotlib** for data visualization of trends.
- Application: Assists therapists by providing emotional trend data and relapse prediction based on historical emotional patterns.

### Memory Exploitation & Binary Exploitation Research
- In-depth exploration of **Return Oriented Programming (ROP)**, **Heap Overflow**, and **Use-After-Free** vulnerabilities on **Ubuntu 18**.
- Tooling: Utilized **GDB**, **Ghidra**, and **pwntools** for debugging, analyzing, and exploiting binary vulnerabilities.
- Goal: Build a knowledge base and contribute to secure coding practices and countermeasures.
